PG_STAT_STATEMENTS

pg_stat_statements module  provides a means for tracking planning and execution statistics of all SQL statements. This extension is not available globally but can be enabled for a specific database with CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements.

Configuration:
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.max = 10000
pg_stat_statements.track = all
track_activity_query_size = 2048
track_io_timing = on


PG_STAT_STATEMENTS.MAX: 
Maximum number of statements tracked by the module.

PG_STAT_STATEMENTS.TRACK:
Controls which statement the module tracks. 
        top (track statements issued directly by clients)
        all (track top-level and nested statements), 
        and none (disable statement statistics collection).

Track_IO_Timing:
 Enables timing of database I/O calls. This parameter is off by default, as it will repeatedly query the operating system for the current time, which may cause significant overhead on some platforms. 

Track_Activity_Query_Size:
parameter sets the number of characters to display when reporting a SQL query. The default value is 1024 bytes.


PG_STAT_STATEMENT_RESET:
Discards all statistics gathered so far by pg_stat_statements. By default, this function can only be executed by superusers.
